    abstract = "Euphemisms are a linguistic device used to soften discussions of sensitive or uncomfortable topics, with death being a prominent example. In this paper, we present a study on the detection of death-related euphemisms in historical literary texts from a corpus containing Danish and Norwegian novels from the late 19th century. We introduce an annotated dataset of euphemistic and literal references to death, including both common and rare euphemisms, ranging from well-established terms to more culturally nuanced expressions. We evaluate the performances of state-of-the-art pre-trained language models fine-tuned for euphemism detection. Our findings show that fixed, literal expressions of death became less frequent over time, while metaphorical euphemisms grew in prevalence. Additionally, euphemistic language was more common in historical novels, whereas contemporary novels tended to refer to death more literally, reflecting the rise of secularism. These results shed light on the shifting discourse on death during a period when the concept of death as final became prominent."
